I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Public Administration and Sociology of the Erasmus University Rotterdam.
I am also part of the [Erasmus Governance Design Studio](https://erasmusgds.com/).
I do research on various topics related to the governance of sustainability. 
My teaching focuses mostly on governance in the public sector.
