<p>I use multiple internet browsers. 
My default browser is <a href="https://qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a>, but for some things that qutebrowser doesnâ€™t handle well I switch to <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>.
I am also experimenting with <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/">Nyxt</a>, which I started exploring as a possible alternative to qutebrowser.
However, it is not yet stable enough for me to make the switch.
Also, some things, like Netflix, do not work on Nyxt yet and I have no idea if there is a way to fix that.</p>
